# Usage
my_car = Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020)

# Accelerate the car by 50 km/h
my_car.accelerate(50)

# The following line would raise an error, because __speed is private
# print(my_car.__speed)  # This will give an attribute error

# Use the method to safely access the speed
current_speed = my_car.get_speed()
print(f"Current speed is {current_speed} km/h")  # Output: Current speed is 50 km/h

# Attempt to directly set a new speed â€“ this will use the setter method which has a check
my_car.set_speed(150)  # This will set the new speed if it's within the valid range
